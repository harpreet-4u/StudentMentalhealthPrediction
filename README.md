# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction During Exams

This project predicts a student's **mental stress level during exams** based on lifestyle and academic habits using a machine learning model. It takes input like sleep hours, study time, diet, social media usage, etc., and gives an instant prediction.

## 🧪 How it works

1. A dataset of 1000 students was created with realistic lifestyle and academic data.
2. A **Decision Tree Classifier** was trained on this data.
3. The model is saved and used in a **Streamlit web app**.
4. Users input their details → the model predicts their stress level.
